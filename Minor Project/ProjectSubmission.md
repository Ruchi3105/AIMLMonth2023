Summary(Optional) :   Which algorithm I use in this minor project give approximately 50 % accuracy for both test and train data. I enjoy doing this project and explore the classification and regression to understand it better. I found some difficulties also while doing task 1. My overall experience regarding this project is nice. Thankyou :)
